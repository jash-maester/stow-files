# Dotfiles

The given files in this repository are my personal Dotfiles which are made GNU-Stow Compatible for ease of installation.

Alternatively if the user wants to use them without GNU Stow, they can do so by just copying the aforementioned Dotflies to their respective locations in .config/, .local/ and ~/ directories as per requirements.

# Dependencies

Further Dependency list will be provided as I harden the Configurations.
